Abstract
Tabular anomaly detection under the one-class classification
setting poses a significant challenge, as it involves accurately
conceptualizing “normal” derived exclusively from a single
category to discern anomalies from normal data variations.
Capturing the intrinsic correlation among attributes within
normal samples presents one promising method for learning the concept. To do so, the most recent effort relies on
a learnable mask strategy with a reconstruction task. However, this wisdom may suffer from the risk of producing uniform masks, i.e., essentially nothing is masked, leading to
less effective correlation learning. To address this issue, we
presume that attributes related to others in normal samples
can be divided into two non-overlapping and correlated subsets, defined as CorrSets, to capture the intrinsic correlation
effectively. Accordingly, we introduce an innovative method
that disentangles CorrSets from normal tabular data. To our
knowledge, this is a pioneering effort to apply the concept
of disentanglement for one-class anomaly detection on tabular data. Extensive experiments on 20 tabular datasets show
that our method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods and leads to an average performance improvement
of 6.1% on AUC-PR and 2.1% on AUC-ROC.

Introduction

Tabular anomaly detection under the one-class classification
setting presumes the availability of only one-class data, i.e.,
the normal class samples for training, while the goal during
the test is to discern anomalies (Chandola, Banerjee, and Kumar 2009; Ruff et al. 2021). In practical scenarios, such as financial fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection, and medical diagnosis (Hilal, Gadsden, and Yawney 2022; Malaiya
et al. 2019; Chen and Konukoglu 2018), this method tries
to detect whether new data points conform to the pattern of
observed normal samples, thereby identifying them as either
normal or abnormal. Given that only normal instances are
available during the training, the inherent challenge lies in
extracting the invariant feature of normal data. An instance
observed with patterns deviating from these characteristics
is detected as an anomaly. However, the lack of prior knowledge on structures in tabular data poses a significant challenge for learning such knowledge (Shenkar and Wolf 2022).

One reasonable way to mitigate this challenge is to focus on capturing the intrinsic correlation among attributes
of normal samples. Once one or more attributes of a sample
deviate anomalously, it is an anomaly, and the correlation
among attributes becomes different from that exhibited in
normal samples. The most recent MCM (Yin et al. 2024)
proposes a learnable mask generator module with a diversity loss to create diverse soft masks (i.e., mask values range
from 0 to 1 for input data). A reconstruction task is then designed to restore the original data from its masked variants.
During inference, anomalous attributes will disrupt the correlations observed in the normal class, leading to a failure to
reconstruct the original data from masked instances, thereby
allowing anomalies to be detected. Despite its efficacy, the
diversity loss may generate masks with nearly uniform values, inducing trivial solutions of the learned intrinsic correlations. Empirical evidence in Figure 1(a) suggests that the

values of all soft masks are around 0.5. In this case, each
attribute is scaled with the same value, indicating essentially
no attribute is masked. Thus, the model learns the objective
of reconstructing the original data from complete features
instead of partial attributes, resulting in less effective extraction of the desired correlation.
In this paper, we presume that attributes related to others
in normal tabular data can be split into two1 non-overlapping
and correlated subsets, termed as CorrSets, to ensure the distillation of the intrinsic correlation among attributes from
normal instances. Building on this premise, this paper validates that disentangling those CorrSets from normal samples
for reconstruction promotes the learning of normal samples’
inside correlations. Specifically, the sufficiently disentangled CorrSets are used to restore the whole original data individually, in which processes of the correlation inside normal data would be well captured by the model. Compared
to MCM (Yin et al. 2024), which may generate ineffective
masks, this approach guarantees that the model reconstructs
the original data with partial attributes, thus strengthening
its ability to extract the correlation within normal samples
and yielding improvements in anomaly detection.
Motivated by the aforementioned assumption, we propose
a novel paradigm named Disent-AD, which efficiently disentangles CorrSets from normal tabular data and adequately
captures the intrinsic correlation. For practical implementation, a two-head self-attention module is utilized to implicitly extract two distinct subsets in latent space. The attention maps depict the attributes of interest to the network.
By learning two independent attention maps, the two attention heads focus on different regions of tabular data, enabling the implicit extraction of distinct attribute subsets. As
shown in Figure 1(b), darker regions in attention maps indicate greater weights. Evidently, the attention module successfully concentrates on two non-overlapping attribute subsets. To ensure that disentangled subsets are correlated, a reconstruction task is performed to restore the original data
by utilizing subset features extracted from either of the two
attention heads. Importantly, this reconstruction process is
strategically employed to detect anomalies rather than aiming for a complete restoration of the original data. During
testing, samples with high reconstruction errors are detected
as anomalies.

Related Work

One-class anomaly detection aims to identify unobserved
class samples during training by utilizing the knowledge
learned from a single normal class. Relying on distance measurement techniques (Breunig et al. 2000), empirical cumulative distribution functions (Li et al. 2022), and regularized
classifiers (Schölkopf et al. 1999) are some of the classical
ways to tackle this task. A straightforward approach involves
modeling a distribution based on normal samples and evaluating the likelihood of each test sample (Zong et al. 2018;
Li et al. 2020). Establishing a reliable decision boundary between normal and anomaly samples through an end-to-end
process with an effective one-class loss function has proven
useful (Ruff et al. 2018). Generating pseudo anomalies is
an alternative way to construct a decision boundary (Goyal
et al. 2020; Cai and Fan 2022), which utilizes adversarial training or variational autoencoder (VAE) (An and Cho
2015) to produce synthetic data that are abnormal yet closely
resemble normal samples. Nevertheless, both methods require specific assumptions about distributions of normal and
anomaly samples, which may not always be appropriate.
Recent methods focus on designing self-supervision
learning tasks to detect anomalies, such as applying geometric transformations to images and predicting the transformation (Golan and El-Yaniv 2018). However, geometric
transformations are essentially not suitable for tabular data.
To tackle this issue, GOAD (Bergman and Hoshen 2020)
develops learnable transformations for tabular data. Inspired
by learnable transformations, NeuTraLAD (Qiu et al. 2021)
designs one contrastive loss to learn the invariant relationship among original and multiple transformed samples for
normal data. With the idea of building a criterion based on
contrastive loss, ICL (Shenkar and Wolf 2022) aims at maximizing the mutual information between each subset and the
rest of the parts in normal tabular data. SLAD (Xu et al.
2023b) proposes scale as a new characteristic for tabular data
to capture the invariant representations of the normal class,
which is treated as the relationship between the dimensionality of attribute subsets and that of their transformed latent
representations. The most recent MCM (Yin et al. 2024) focuses on learning the intrinsic correlation of normal samples
by restoring original data from data masked by diverse soft
masks. Unlike previous methods, our work concentrates on
implicitly disentangling CorrSets from normal data to extract the intrinsic correlation for anomaly detection.
Semi- and weakly-supervised anomaly detection on
tabular data assumes that anomaly samples are accessible
during training (Yoon et al. 2020; Chang et al. 2023; Pang
et al. 2023). Introducing anomaly knowledge into the training process enables these methods to extract discriminative
knowledge between normal and anomaly features. In this paper, we train the model for anomaly detection without prior
knowledge of anomalies. This task is particularly challenging as it involves constructing a criterion for distinguishing
between normal and abnormal samples without explicit examples of anomalies to guide the process.

• To our knowledge, this is one pioneering work that leverages the concept of disentanglement to enhance the efficiency of tabular one-class anomaly detection.
• We propose a novel paradigm that learns the intrinsic correlation by disentangling two distinct and correlated attribute subsets from normal tabular data.

noise well, which barely affects the distinction between normal and abnormal samples. Accordingly, a criterion based
on the reconstruction error for anomaly detection can be
built by disentangling CorrSets from normal samples. It is
worth noting that our method leverages reconstruction to detect anomalies rather than fully restoring the original data.
The framework of our method is presented in Figure 3.
Given one sample for illustrating our procedure, the encoder
takes it as input and extracts its latent features. Then, a twohead self-attention module is utilized to disentangle tabular data for extracting features of two attribute subsets. Afterward, a decoder maps these features back to the input
space for independently reconstructing the original data. Our
model is trained in an end-to-end fashion and optimized by
a disentangling loss and a reconstruction loss. During inference, the sum of the two subsets’ reconstruction errors
serves as the anomaly score for each test sample.

Methodology

Problem Statement

One-class anomaly detection on tabular data setup involves
a training set Dtrain = {xi ∈ RM }N
i=1 , which consists of
N normal samples with M attributes. A test set, Dtest =
{xi ∈ RM , yi ∈ Y}Ji=1 , consists of samples xi with labels
yi , where Y = {0, 1} (0 denotes a normal and 1 denotes an
anomaly). By training on Dtrain , a deep anomaly detection
model constructs a scoring function ϕ : RM → R that quantitatively assesses the abnormality levels of new data points.

Two-head self-attention

Figure 3: Illustration of our framework. The model consists
of three modules: an encoder, a two-head self-attention, and
a decoder. The network is trained under the constraint of a
disentangling loss and a reconstruction loss.

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection often trains the
network with a conventional classification task (e.g., tenclass classification) and identifies test samples belonging to
the different distribution from which the training set is sampled (Liu et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2022). Training with a multiclass classification task permits OOD detection methods
to capture discriminative knowledge across various classes,
thereby facilitating effective estimation of the training data
distribution. However, our task aims to train a network with
only one class for anomaly detection, which is more challenging as learning from one class may lead the model to
produce predictions arbitrarily.

Our Proposed Method

To capture the correlation inside normal samples, we propose to disentangle CorrSets from them. There are two main
components in our method: disentangling and learning correlation. Practicality, we leverage a two-head self-attention
for implicit disentanglement, and a reconstruction task guarantees the correlation between two subsets.

Overview

Our strategy for anomaly detection is illustrated in Figure 2. Considering a tabular dataset where each sample is
composed of M attributes: xi = {a1 , a2 , · · · , aM }. We

of anomalies deviate from those of normal instances. There
is a case where anomalous attributes are not in two subsets, but the model fails to restore them using normal attribute subsets, still producing large reconstruction errors.
Noisy attributes are unavoidable in real-world scenarios;
however, neither normal nor anomaly attributes reconstruct

Disentangling Aiming to extract two distinct attribute
subsets from normal samples, we utilize a two-head selfattention module to implicitly disentangle tabular data in latent space. The attention map describes attributes that the
network focuses on, and the greater the attention weight,
the more interested the network is. Learning two independent attention maps allows two heads of the attention module to extract latent features of two distinct attribute subsets
in tabular data, thus enabling implicit disentanglement. We
respectively demonstrate the importance of extracting two
subsets and disentangling with two-head attention for capturing effective correlations in Section 4.6.
The attention module is applied to latent features extracted by the encoder to disentangle tabular data. To successfully adopt the attention module, we convert tabular data
from row vectors into column vectors, i.e., xi ∈ RM ×1 ,
where M still denotes the number of attributes, and each

The overall loss function for training our method is defined as follows:

where we equal the weight for Ld and Lr to avoid a possible
bias to one loss. By training with Loverall , the model is able
to extract CorrSets, thereby learning the inherent correlation
of normal data.

Anomaly Score for Inference

The determination of a test sample as normal or abnormal is
made by evaluating the reconstruction error. The cosine similarity between attention maps is not included in the anomaly
score function. It is due to that the model is trained to extract two distinct subsets. Empirical evidence is presented in
Figure 4. In the right part, the disentangling loss of anomalies varies almost identically to that of normal samples and
eventually nears 0. As for the reconstruction error, the network aims to model the intrinsic correlation of normal class,
thus test normal samples generally yield low errors. While
anomalies consistently exhibit high reconstruction errors.
Therefore, we define the anomaly score function ϕ (xi ) with
the MSE function as below:

ϕ (xi ) =
(xi − x̂si h ) .

attribute owns 1 feature channel. The encoder fE maps xi
to latent features zi ∈ RM ×C = fE (xi ), where C refers to
the channel number of each attribute. With the attention, zi
yields queries, keys, and values, symbolized respectively as
qish , kish , vish ∈ RM ×C , for each head h ∈ {1, 2}. The computation of the two attention maps is formalized as follows:

where the size of wish is M × M . To accomplish the objective of disentangling two distinct attribute subsets from each
training instance, it is imperative to learn two independent
attention maps. Our strategy is to diminish the similarity between them. To this end, a cosine similarity loss is employed
to yield a disentangling loss:

Ld =

where ∥ · ∥2 is the L2 norm. As Ld approaches 0, the two
attention maps are orthogonal, thus allowing two heads to
focus on distinct attribute subsets. Drawing from empirical
observations, due to the absence of two attention maps with
inverse relationships in single samples, the absolute value is
not employed in the computation of Ld . Consequently, this
restriction confines the range of Ld to interval [0, 1], despite
the range of the cosine similarity loss spanning [−1, 1]. We
validate the significance of Ld for learning the intrinsic correlation of normal data in Section 4.6.

h=1,2

The anomaly scores for normal data are expected to be as
small as possible. For anomalies, whether or not the anomalous attributes are included in disentangled subsets, the
model fails to reconstruct the complete input as the intrinsic correlation of the anomalies deviates from that of normal
samples, resulting in high anomaly scores. The greater the
anomaly score, the more likely that a sample is an anomaly.

Experiments

Datasets

Our evaluation encompasses 20 tabular datasets, aligning
with previous work (Yin et al. 2024). 12 of them are obtained
from the Outlier Detection Datasets (ODDS) (Rayana 2016),
while the remainder are derived from ADBench (Han et al.
2022), which cross various application scenarios, including
healthcare, finance, and more. For specific dataset statistics,
please see Supplementary D.

Learning Correlation With disentangling, we extract two
distinct attribute subsets from normal tabular data. In order
to capture the intrinsic correlation, it is essential to ensure
that the disentangled subsets are correlated. Therefore, we
perform a reconstruction task to individually restore the input sample from the features of each subset. Such a strategy
guides the network in extracting CorrSets, thus progressing
the learning of the intrinsic correlation of normal instances.
As a result of directing two attention heads to focus on
distinct attribute subsets, the latent features of those can be
obtained by:
ẑish = wish vish , h ∈ {1, 2},

Evaluation Metrics

Experiments on tabular data are conducted by following previous work (Xu et al. 2023b; Yin et al. 2024). We randomly
sample 50% of the normal samples as the training set, and
the remaining normal samples with all anomaly samples are
combined into the test set. Area Under the Precision-Recall
Curve (AUC-PR) and Area Under the Receiver-OperatingCharacteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) are selected as our evaluation criteria. These two metrics can objectively evaluate
detection performance without making any assumption on
the decision threshold. All reported results are averaged over
three independent trials.

based on their official open-source code, and original results
reported in their paper are presented in Supplementary E.

In our network architecture, a three-layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with LeakyReLU activation function forms the
encoder, and the decoder is symmetrically designed to the
encoder. For the adaption of the attention module to tabular data, we transform row vectors into column vectors for
most datasets and perform a patch-splitting preprocessing
method for the rest to facilitate disentanglement, mostly derived from image scenarios. We consider the data structures
of these datasets to be too complicated to affect disentangling. The preprocessing method is performed by splitting
the data into three patches with the size of M/2 and treating
each patch as an attribute to compose new data to simplify
the data structure. We present a detailed description of the
preprocessing method in Supplementary A. For datasets applied with the preprocessing method, we set epochs to 200
and the channel number C of latent features to 512 for efficient convergence, while epochs to 100 and C to 128 for
the rest. Due to the large variation in the number of samples
between datasets, ranging from 129 to 299,285, we use different batch sizes for different datasets. The parameters of
the network are optimized by Adam with a uniform learning
rate of 1e-4 for all datasets. See Supplementary B for more
implementation details.

Anomaly Detection Performance

Table 1 and 2 present the AUC-PR and AUC-ROC results
of our method alongside the competing methods across
20 datasets, respectively. Despite the heterogeneity in the
datasets, our method achieves the best overall performance
on both two evaluation metrics, outperforming the secondbest method by an average of 6.1% on AUC-PR and 2.1% on
AUC-ROC. To prevent a few datasets from dominating the
averaged results, we also present the mean rank for comparison. The best mean ranking out of 12 is obtained by
our method, which is considerably lower than competing
methods. At the dataset level, our method beats competitors on 13 out of 20 datasets according to both AUC-PR
and AUC-ROC, while exhibiting competitive performance
on the remaining datasets. Significant performance gains are
obtained by our method on some datasets compared to the
second-best method, e.g., 16.3% improvement in AUC-PR

Baseline Methods

Our method is compared with eleven outstanding tabular
anomaly detection methods. IForest (Liu, Ting, and Zhou
2008), LOF (Breunig et al. 2000), OCSVM (Schölkopf
et al. 1999), and ECOD (Li et al. 2022) represent classi13065

Ablation Study

Four datasets sourced from different application scenarios
are selected to conduct the ablation study: Thyroid (healthcare), Arrhythmia (healthcare), Glass (forensic), and Satellite (satellite image). The results are reported in Table 3.
Disentangling two subsets is crucial for learning the
intrinsic correlation of normal data: We design “Variant 1” that learns one attention map with a one-head selfattention module. Restoring original data from one subset
makes the model extract attributes that can be used for reconstruction. However, the attention module might focus on
each attribute to minimize reconstruction loss, causing the
model to struggle with capturing the intrinsic correlation of
normal samples. According to the experimental results, the
detection performance of “Variant 1” is much lower than that
of our method, validating the significance of disentangling
two subsets for learning the correlation in normal samples.
Extracting two subsets with two-head self-attention
can capture better correlation than with one-head selfattention: “Variant 2” disentangles two subsets with a onehead self-attention module. We implement it by wis2 =
1−wis1 , where wis1 is produced by the attention module, and
they are independent of each other. Evidently, “Variant 2” is
significantly inferior to our method. It is due to that noise attributes might be contained in subsets according to wi2 , leading to less effective learning of the intrinsic correlation. In
our method, disentangling with the two-head self-attention

Table 3: Ablation study of our method and its variants.

module helps reduce the effect of noise attributes on learning the correlation. Additionally, the performance gap between “Variant 2” and “Variant 1” further demonstrates the
significance of disentangling two subsets.
Constraining the two subsets to be distinct is necessary
for learning the correlation within normal data: A substantial performance drop is observed in “Variant 3”, since
the absence of the disentangling loss hinders the model from
extracting two non-overlapping attribute subsets. This indicates that the disentangling loss is crucial in our method. We
report the results of replacing our disentangling loss with
MCM (Yin et al. 2024)’s diversity loss in Supplementary E.

our method experiences minimal performance degradation
as the anomaly contamination ratio increases, consistently
yielding the best results in each case. Such empirical evidence justifies the outstanding robustness of our method to
anomaly contamination.

Analysis on the Preprocessing Method Table 4 presents
the detection performance of preprocessing data into various
data shapes, where Satellite and Satimage-2 are selected as
illustrative datasets. They are sourced from satellite image
scenarios and preprocessed in our implementation. There
are overlaps between split patches when the data shape is
2 × 3M/4 or 3 × M/2. Evidently, there is a noticeable
performance improvement when applying the preprocessing
method, as a reduced number of attributes enables the model
to disentangle data more easily, thereby facilitating correlation learning. According to the empirical results, we use
the data shape of 3 × M/2 in our implementation. We also
test our method’s robustness to randomly ordered attributes
in original data when using the preprocessing method. Although there is a slight performance drop, the results are still
comparable, which verifies that our method is robust to the
randomly ordered attributes.

Further Analysis

Analysis on Subset Number Figure 5 reports the detection performance of our method vs. different numbers of
disentangled attribute subsets, where Thyroid, Arrhythmia,
Glass, and Satellite are used as illustrative datasets. Evidently, as the subset number is increased, the performance
drops slightly, partially as extracting more correlated subsets raises the difficulty of training convergence. Additionally, there is a case that multiple (> 2) subsets related to each
other are not present in normal samples, which may lead to
computational redundancy. This analysis indicates the rationale of our two subsets strategy. Visualization of attention
maps for three subsets is shown in Supplementary C.

Conclusion

In this paper, we design a novel disentangling-based method
to learn the correlation inside normal tabular data by extracting two distinct and correlated attribute subsets for anomaly
detection. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully leverage disentanglement for tabular anomaly detection under the one-class classification setting. Extensive
experiments conducted on 20 tabular datasets sourced from
diverse application scenarios with AUC-PR and AUC-ROC
metrics evidence that our method outperforms the existing
best methods. However, it is imperative to note that our current design specifically caters to tabular data and, as such,
does not directly apply to other data types, such as image or
point cloud data. We intend to explore disentangling-based
methods for non-tabular data types in future work.

Robustness to Anomaly Contamination In real-world
anomaly detection, the training set may be contaminated,
with a small percentage of anomalies included. By reference to (Yin et al. 2024), we successively set the anomaly
contamination ratio to 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% to analyze the
robustness of our method to anomaly contamination. Selecting Breastw and Cardiotocography as typical datasets,
analysis results are shown in Figure 6. It is observed that
